This lab was so long to finish ðŸ˜­ It wasn't hard but there were a lot of steps to follow and I realized how using CLI to configure network connectivity (the VPC transit, firewall rule, all that shebang) is way better than using the GUI. The GUI is just too slow and cumbersome for this kind of work.
Note: the instructions asked us to do it on GUI, I think there might be a way to do it via CLI but it'd take time to figure it out and we have only 1.5h to finish the lab and restart otherwise
